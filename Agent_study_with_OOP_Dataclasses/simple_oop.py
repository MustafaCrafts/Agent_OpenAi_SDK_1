# My Personal Opinion:
# Dataclasses are better than normal OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). 
# Nowadays, the market and developer communities prefer using dataclasses. A big change is that OpenAI is also using dataclasses to create its SDK.
# No need for 'dataclasses' or 'typing' imports in normal OOP for this example.
# In @dataclass, we needed 'from dataclasses import dataclass' and sometimes 'from typing import ClassVar, List'.

# Example 1: MyDataclass
class MyDataclass:
    """
    A simple class with:
    - A class (static) variable: shared by all objects.
    - An instance variable: unique for each object.
    """
    # Class variable: Belongs to the class itself, shared by all instances.
    # Difference: In @dataclass, this was written as 'class_variable: ClassVar[int] = 42'.
    # In normal OOP, we just define it directly without 'ClassVar'.
    class_variable = 42

    # Constructor: This sets up instance variables when you create an object.
    # Difference: In @dataclass, this '__init__' method is automatically made for you based on
    # the instance variables you list (e.g., 'instance_variable: int').
    # In normal OOP, you have to write it yourself.
    def __init__(self, instance_variable: int):
        self.instance_variable = instance_variable  # Unique for each object

    # Instance Method: Uses 'self' to access the object's data.
    # Difference: This stays the same in both @dataclass and normal OOP.
    def age(self):
        return self.instance_variable

    # Class Method: Uses 'cls' to work with the class itself.
    # Difference: No change here; @classmethod works the same in both.
    @classmethod
    def class_age(cls):
        return cls.class_variable

    # Difference: No change; @staticmethod is the same in both.

# Example 2: Book
